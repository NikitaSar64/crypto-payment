          widgets, where the user can input all required info and complete the
          transaction without ever leaving your website! Our crypto payment
          gateway is secure, and we don’t hold or store your funds in any way.
          The future is in the blockchain, and using our crypto payment
          processor is the best way forward for your online business, store, or
          service.
